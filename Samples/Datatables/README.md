# Tableau DataTables Extension

The Tableau DataTables Extension was built for several purposes:

- To aide in my understanding of this wonderful new Tableau functionality.
- To leverage the widely used DataTables.net libraries in Tableau dashboards.
- To provide an open source example for others to look at, learn from, and improve upon.
